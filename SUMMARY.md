# CRUK technical exercise (React) Summary

## Why have I chosen the React Hook Form over the Formik library?

```
ReactHookForm: {
  pros: “Ability to isolate component re-renders. React Hook Form is generally considered to be faster and more lightweight than Formik. It’s easy to understand and has a strong focus on performance.”,
  cons: “Fewer built-in UI components compared to Formik”,
}

Formik: {
  pros: “Offer more control over form state. Offers more features. Ease of use. More flexibility",
  cons: “May require additional optimization to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Slightly heavier in terms of bundle size compared to React Hook Form”,
}
```

This choice is based on its user-friendly, performant, lightweight and flexible nature, which aligns with the goal of writing clean and production-ready code with a focus on quality.
